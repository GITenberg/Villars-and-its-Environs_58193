<h1>VILLARS<br />
<span class="smaller">AND ITS ENVIRONS</span></h1>

<p>There is no more interesting district in the Rhone
valley, perhaps even in the whole of Switzerland,
than that which lies around the north-western entrance
to the upper and main portion of the Canton
of Valais—that impressive, narrow entrance formed
by the buttress cliffs of the Dent de Morcles and the
Dent du Midi, just inside of which nestles the ancient
town of St. Maurice. For this district is compact of
great variety. It holds examples of all that goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the making of Switzerland’s fascination. It holds the
fertile plain with its broad, rushing river, the Rhone;
it holds, in Aigle and St. Maurice, two châteaued
towns with long and active histories of their own; it
holds, in Bex, one of the most delightful spots imaginable
for spring and autumn; in Leysin, a world-known
mountain health resort; popular mountain
pleasure resorts in Villars, Chesières, Gryon, Les
Plans, Champéry and Morgins; and, in the natives
of the Val d’Illiez, it holds a distinctive race with
a distinctive tongue. Moreover, it contains, in the
huge erratic blocks near Monthey and near Bex,
remarkable vestiges of the great glacier which one
time filled this valley and flowed on over what is
now Lac Léman;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it has noble peaks in number and
of no mean order for the climber; it possesses at
least three glaciers which, though small, are full of
individual interest and beauty; and it harbours a
flora so rich as to have become renowned. And yet
all of this, and more besides, is packed within a comparatively
restricted area. One reason for this great
variety in so small a compass is the curiously striking
fact of the Rhone dividing Vaud from Valais, and
thus at the same time dividing to a marked extent
what is wild and truly Alpine circumstance from what
is relatively tame and rural. For Champéry, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at some 650 feet lower altitude than Villars,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> its <i>vis-à-vis</i>
across the valley of the Rhone, partakes of
the rude Alpine character of Valais, whilst Villars has
what may be called the civilized setting so generally
characteristic of Vaud. The difference may be noted
in their respective vegetations—in the trees and
flowers. For instance, at Champéry the bell-gentian
(<i>Gentiana excisa</i>) and the yellow pea (<i>Lathyrus
luteus</i>) can be found within a few minutes of the
hotels, whereas at Villars one must walk at least an
hour and a half higher up to find the gentian, and
the pea I have not found there at all. Or again,
Villars possesses fine deciduous trees in quantity and
its pines are perfect park-like specimens; whilst at
Champéry deciduous trees are inconspicuous and the
pines are of the rugged Alpine order. Villars possesses
the finer panorama—one of the finest in Switzerland,
particularly in winter—but Champéry provides the
truer Alpine pictures, especially in summer.</p>

<p>Indeed the very variety of this district—historically,
geographically, botanically sets a difficult task
before so slight a volume as this present. However,
an attempt must be made towards adequacy. No
time can be wasted, and we had best start at St.
Maurice and work diligently round in a circle by
way of Bex, Les Plans, and Villars, thence to Aigle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and Leysin, ending up with Monthey, Morgins, and
Champéry, meanwhile knitting the whole district together
with general and comparative facts.</p>

<h2>ST. MAURICE</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/fp-illus2.jpg" width="440" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ST. MAURICE: THE CHÂTEAU AND THE ROCK OF DAILLY</p>
</div>

<p>The scene as one approaches St. Maurice from
the north-west is among the most noted in Valais.
The old castle hugging the cliff to the right and
dominating the swift and troubled Rhone rushing low
beneath the ancient stone bridge, with the great sheer
Rock of Dailly to the left—it is a memorable picture,
particularly in spring, when the wild wallflowers and
laburnum deck the castle cliffs, and the young tints
of spruce and larch soften the stern aspect of the
fortress. Fortress? Yes, the Rock of Dailly, buttress
of the Dent de Morcles, is a veritable Gibraltar, designed
to stop and crush all invasion by way of the
Simplon and the Grand St. Bernard. From an arrant
civilian’s standpoint it would seem an absolute impossibility
for an invading army to live to pass the
narrow defile of St. Maurice. Those innumerable and
mighty guns hidden in the face of that grim precipice
are apparently able to overwhelm all intruders, and
the defile of St. Maurice would seem as safe to-day
as when in olden times it was closed by a great gate.
One has only to watch at nighttime the firing practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
illuminated by searchlights and directed against
the forests and cliffs high upon the Dent du Midi,
to be impressed with the awful deadliness of this rock-fortress.
It seems, of course, a sacrilege so to insult
the lovely, peaceful Alps; it seems a gross, insensate
outrage upon a land pre-eminently designed to wean
men from the cult of war.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But of its practical effectiveness
in case of need there can be no manner of
doubt. Napoleon to-day would have to go round
some other way to get to Italy; he could not now
use Switzerland as a convenient passage. And yet,
and yet, it seems to me a shame when I remember
the delightful months I spent upon the summit of
the Rock of Dailly some five-and-twenty years ago,
and think that now it is closed to mere civilians,
that the magnificent prospect, with a sheer drop
down upon the Baths of Lavey, is now only examined
by the trainer of far-reaching cannon, and that the
exquisite carpet of Alpine flowers around the Dent
de Morcles is trampled under foot by companies and
battalions. It is sometimes hard to reconcile one’s
quiet ideals with the stern exigencies of life, and
perhaps this is particularly so in Switzerland. It
was on the slopes high above Dailly, now a vast
manœuvre ground for troops, that I once fled hurriedly
in the front of a stampeding herd of cattle driven mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
by flies, and that I only just escaped destruction by
scrambling on to the roof of a friendly cheese châlet.
Needless to say, I do not rank such incidents among
my quiet ideals.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>St. Maurice can boast of as long a history as any
town in the country. Looking backwards it is lost
in the mists of Time, and it only reveals itself with
real distinctness when the Romans made the town
the centre of their activities in Valais, and Julius
Cæsar threw up walls and fortifications around it
and gave it the name of <i>Tarnade</i> or <i>Ager Tarnadensis</i>.
The well-known savant and archæologist,
Dean Bourban, of the Abbey of St. Maurice, says
that the road which crosses the bridge and runs
beside the Rhone, through the defile, through the
town and on to Martigny and the Grand St. Bernard,
is the selfsame road used by the Gauls on their way
to Italy, and by the Romans on their way to Gaul
and Germany. There is at Bourg St. Pierre, the
last village on the road to the Grand St. Bernard,
an ancient milestone, marking the twenty-fourth mile
between Aosta and Martigny on the great military
route which ran from Milan, through St. Maurice,
to Mayence in Germany. On the front of the old
town hall of St. Maurice is an inscription saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
“I am Christian since the year 58”. According to
tradition St. Peter crossed the Grand St. Bernard
and preached Christianity throughout Valais, and if
this be fact, then he must of necessity have been
to St. Maurice. But the town’s present name was
not then in existence; it is derived from the massacre
in 302 of the Theban Legion commanded by Maurice.
The massacre is said to have occurred in what is
now the Bois Noir, about two miles out along the
road to Martigny—a wild sparse forest of stunted
pines beneath which the lovely rosy springtime heather
(<i>Erica carnea</i>) luxuriates. This forest was the scene,
too, of the terrible rockfall in 1835 from the summit
of the Dent du Midi, which mountain, in its grandest
and most gaunt aspect, dominates this part of the
valley, having as <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Dent de Morcles.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The old Abbey of St. Maurice, built upon pagan
foundations, was for centuries a spoilt child of the
Church. Endowments and gifts were showered upon
it by Charlemagne and other kings and princes, and
its actually existing treasure is priceless, including
as it does specimens of gold and silversmiths’ art
from the sixth to the seventeenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
up on the side of the precipitous cliffs at the back
of the abbey is an ancient hermitage. As one looks
at it from the town there appears no sign of a path
or even of a ledge for the chapel; but on closer inspection
one finds a steep and stony way up, bordered
at intervals throughout its length by Stations of the
Cross. When I visited it some years ago the hermit
was absent, but there were rats in abundance. Pilgrimages
to this chapel used to be frequent (I believe
that it is closed at present), and I understand that on
these occasions freshly broken stone was strewn about
the path, and that those who felt their consciences in
need of drastic measures went up the whole way on
their hands and knees.</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ climb above the Château of St. Maurice
(now the gendarmerie and prison) is the beautiful
Fairies’ Grotto, one of the natural wonders of this
district. It is noted locally as having been the residence
of Frisette, the good fairy, after her troubles
and vexations with the bad fairy, Turlure, who, if my
memory serves me, frequented the woods and pastures
around Bex. The Canton of Valais is remarkably
rich in legend. If we accept the result of the
patient and exhaustive researches of Mme F. Byse,
Milton must have made himself familiar with certain
of these fairy tales when he was at Bex on his way
from Italy; for <i>L’Allegro</i> is held to contain conceits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and fancies gathered from this district. Emile Javelle,
the famous author-alpinist (his title for himself was
<i>clubiste inutile</i>!), in writing of his first ascent of the
Dent du Midi, tells of his guide’s fear of the dreadful,
fiery, devastating dragon that for ages had inhabited
the very district through which they must pass that
of Bonaveau and the <i>vallon</i> of Susanfe, above Champéry.
I myself have had narrated to me at midnight
creepy hair-lifting stories of the doings of malevolent
spirits doomed since ages to frequent certain old
châlets around Champéry, notably those on the high
plateau of Barmaz—upon which châlets I involuntarily
keep one careful eye whenever I am in their
neighbourhood. On another occasion at Champéry,
in early morning, a hurrying man, with awe in his
eyes, breathlessly gave me to understand that a boy,
whilst sound asleep, had been transported on a blanket
in the dead of the previous night from his bed in a
châlet high above the village to the bed of the torrent
far below the village, and that he had awakened to
find himself lying among the boulders with the icy
water all but dashing over him.</p>

<p>But we must be moving on. To reach Bex we may
either cross the bridge, the other side of which is the
territory of Vaud, and follow the road that winds along
the base of wooded cliffs, or else after crossing the
bridge turn to the left up a path that leads through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the earthwork fortifications and then through vineyards
to the sweet-chestnut woods of Chiètres and the
timbered hill crowned by the remnants of the castle
of Duin; or, if we are game for a long, delightful Alpine
walk, we may leave St. Maurice by the south-eastern
exit, cross the Rhone to the Baths of Lavey—boasting
of evil-smelling but curative waters—past a picturesque
waterfall, then up the ever-ascending road to the village
of Morcles (taking its name from the great Dent which
towers above it), thence a path leads up through the
forest and across the pasture-slopes to the famous
Croix de Javernaz<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—famous for its grand view down the
Rhone valley to Lac Léman and the Jura Mountains,
and for its wonderfully rich Alpine flora; from there
the descent is continuous until the highroad is struck
at Bévieux, whence a tram runs in a few minutes to</p>

<h2>BEX</h2>

<p class="caption">BEX: THE CROIX DE JAVERNAZ AND THE DENT DE MORCLES</p>
</div>

<p>As a town Bex is somnolent; a sort of old-world
slumber which is scarcely dissipated even when the
hotels are at their fullest. Perhaps that mood agrees
best with the eminently dream-like landscape. I know
no scene in Switzerland that is more suggestive of the
studied and bewitching pose of stageland than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from the slopes of Montet immediately at the back of
the town. On the left the Croix de Javernaz and the
Dent de Morcles, with steep woods flowing to the
plain; on the right the gaunt <i>Cime de l’Est</i> of the
Dent du Midi, its base enveloped in a filmy blue haze;
and just in the centre of the picture the chestnut groves
on the hill of Chiètres, topped by the old Tour de Duin
cleanly defined against the opening in the cliffs at St.
Maurice—an opening cut as if on purpose to disclose
the snows and ice of the Aiguille du Tour and the
glaciers of Trient and Des Grands. Seen in spring,
when cherry blossom powders the woods, or when the
apple trees are rosy-white and the fields all starred
with flowers; seen in autumn, when the year’s last
burst of life fires the beech and cherry and burnishes
the larch and chestnut; seen at sunset, when the whole
broad foreground is in cool-grey shadow and the sun’s
red glow rests only on the glaciers beyond St. Maurice;
seen at such moments as these this landscape is truly
one of fairyland, one of which one can never tire, and
which surely will bring to Bex an ever-increasing
popularity. At present this easy-going little town
(except when the <i>foehn</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> sets its châlets ablaze—as
has happened three times recently—or when its river,
the Avançon, rising in vernal wrath, throws down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
bridges and floods the streets!) is mostly renowned
for its salt mines and baths. These salt mines are in
the abrupt cliffs beyond Bévieux, and are said to have
been discovered by a goat, which was noticed to be
licking the rocks with most persistent relish. As goats
are notoriously fond of salt, this tale may be quite true.
To those who do not mind a rather damp scramble
within the bowels of the cliff, these mines are well
worth a visit.</p>

<p>But Bex is also renowned for its wild flowers. It
was whilst director of the salt mines that Haller wrote
his <i>Histoire des Plantes de la Suisse</i>. Milton could
have been no keen observer of such things if he saw
only fields of daisies! The hepatica (red, white, but
mostly blue) in the woods about Bévieux are simply
marvellous, relieved as they are by the carpet of dead
beech leaves and by innumerable clumps of primroses,
blue, white, and lilac violets, rich crimson and peacock-blue
vernal vetch, yellow-and-white boxleaved polygala,
and the lovely profusion of white and blush-tinted wood
anemones. There are fields, too, of Star of Bethlehem
on the plain towards the Rhone, where also the rare
yellow tulip may be found. The brilliant-orange <i>Lilium
croceum</i> and the curious and very local Snake’s-head
Lily are to be found in the neighbourhood, but I had
better not say where. The gorge of the River Gryonne,
at the back of the hill of Montet, is crowded in early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
spring with the beautiful Snowflake. <i>Astrantia major</i>
and <i>Trollius europæus</i> (the Globe Flower) luxuriate
together by the hill of Chiètres. But perhaps the hill
of Montet is the paradise <i>par excellence</i> of the botanist
and flower lover. Here are orchids in abundance and
variety—the Frog, Fly, Bee, Spider, and the yellowish-white
Helleborine among others; <i>Gentiana verna</i>
carpets the short turf with heavenly blue; the tall
yellow gentian is on the open summit; <i>Erica carnea</i>
grows on the steep hillside beyond the forest, and the
shady woods that descend upon Bévieux are simply
packed with Lily-of-the-Valley; the gem of this hill, however,
is the mass of bright-blue Lithospermum, in colour
almost rivalling the vernal gentian; why its Latin Christian
name should be <i>purpurea</i> I really cannot tell.</p>

<p>This, then, is what Voltaire, in his love of town life
and society, was pleased to look upon as being buried
alive in the “caverns of Bex”!<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Can we really be at
a loss with Nature as she is at Bex? It would seem
impossible. That Nature has shortcomings is only
natural, and I think we may say, as says the inspired
Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore, in <i>The Gardener</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Infinite wealth is not yours, my patient and dusky mother dust!</div>
<div class="verse">The gift of gladness that you have for us is never perfect.</div>
<div class="verse">The toys that you make for your children are fragile.</div>
<div class="verse">You cannot satisfy all our hungry hopes, but should I desert you for that?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature at Bex may not be perfect, but certainly in
very many respects she is as perfect as she can be,
and we are by no means deserting her though necessity
obliges us to pass on to</p>

<h2>LES PLANS</h2>

<p>For Nature in most lavish mood accompanies us.
No matter at what season, the two and a half hours
road from Bex to Les Plans is full of beauty for the
eye and mind, but if there is one season above the
others when this beauty is the more bewitching it is
that of spring. Oh, why—a thousand times why!—is
spring in the Alps so neglected by travellers seeking
charm and pleasure? Why are the Kursaals crowded
in spring by those who, at Custom’s bidding, are waiting
for a later, more healthy and resplendent season?
Time will come when Custom in this matter will surely
be sent to the rightabout, and Alpine spring will be
as sought after as now is Alpine winter. It is only
about twelve years ago that we who wintered on the
Alps were looked upon as mere eccentrics; yet these
few short years have proved that we were in truth
the favoured pioneers of a season that is actually
becoming prime rival to that of summer. In very
faith I feel that so it shall be with spring, and that
a few years hence a new and fascinating experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
will have revealed itself to a hitherto indifferent
world.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As one emerges from the timbered gorge, one is
confronted at once by the jagged mountains of the
chain of the Grand Muveran; not as they appear in
summer, with bare, forbidding precipice and scree,
but as they can appear in springtime only, clothed
about in winter’s dissipating snows and gladdened
by an immediate foreground of glistening crocuses
on the brown orchard slopes of Frenière. At this
point, looking back, one has a splendid view of the
giant hill that carries Villars upon its breast; but the
village that one sees with its old church tower clinging
to the side at a height of 1133 metres, and seemingly
in difficulty to restrain itself from slipping into the gulf,
is Gryon, where Juste Olivier, one of Switzerland’s
most tuneful poets, spent his last years and sang imperishable
songs—songs that have found a place in the
heart and life of the people, particularly when the theme
is the <i>mi-été</i> festivities at Anzeindaz and Taveyannaz.
These midsummer fêtes are held annually in connection
with the cattle and cheese industry: they are delightfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
typical of old-world custom, and the poet has done
much to render them impervious to the destructive
note of modern sophistication. Both pasturages lie
on the mountains between Villars and Les Plans, and
are easy excursions from either of these places and
from Gryon. Anzeindaz is the more wild and romantic
of the two, its surroundings lending themselves admirably
to these picturesque timeworn merrymakings;
for the pasturage lies at the foot of the rugged
Diablerets, at the foot, too, of a glacier, and at the
base of a wild col which, although this is a closed
district against hunters, is a spot that knows well
the poachers of eagles. There can be little doubt
of which way Juste Olivier would cast his vote with
regard to the railway that it is proposed shall desecrate
these fascinating wilds, dissipating their guileless,
primitive associations. He would be on the side of
the angels; and the angels are on the side of the
<i>Heimatschutz</i> or League for the Preservation of
Natural Beauty.</p>

<p class="caption">LES PLANS: AVALANCHE FALLING FROM THE GRAND MUVERAN</p>
</div>

<p>Les Plans lies snug upon a verdant, watered
plateau surrounded on all sides but one by lofty
mountains. To the west rises the steep glacier of
Plan Névé and the massive form of the Grand Muveran,
beloved of Eugène Rambert, famous alpinist-author-botanist,
whose name, together with those of Juste
Olivier and Jean Muret, is graven upon the Muveran’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sheer precipice at romantic Pont de Nant. At this
latter place—only a brief walk from Les Plans—there
is a most interesting Alpine garden belonging to the
University of Lausanne; it is especially charming in
spring, with floral gems of purest hues backed by the
translucent ice and snow of the Glacier de Martinet
and the Dent de Morcles.</p>

<p>We must now return to Bex and there take the
mountain railway up to Villars. It is an exceedingly
picturesque line, winding about through woods and
pastures, and providing at each turn a changing, ever-widening
prospect. The mountains to which we
have become accustomed in the plain take upon
themselves superior proportions, and their increasing
majesty and mystery come as an inevitable, surprised
delight. But, for the journey, I will confide you, without
apology, to the tender care of a versatile and well-known
devotee of this lovely neighbourhood, my friend
Mr. D. R. Kelleher, who in his own quaint way will
transport you to</p>

<h2>VILLARS IN WANING SUMMER</h2>

<p>“The incident occurred in a mountain train carrying
slowly, as is its wont, up the wooded slope, a
‘conducted’ party of English tourists. A little grey-eyed
man was sitting in the corner, opposite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
prosperous-looking woman dressed in a black dolman
and clinging with traditional awe to her umbrella.
Both were manifestly thrilled by the scenes through
which they were passing, and not a little bewildered
by the profusion of wonders in Alp, tree, and sky.
At last the lady, devastated by her curiosity, broke
silence in the following scene:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Lady <span class="smaller">(<i>looking anxiously through window at clump of pine trees
rich with yellow cones</i>)</span>: “John, look at yon trees with
the fruit on.”</p>

<p>The Man: “Eh, but they look like bananas.”</p>

<p>The Lady <span class="smaller">(<i>lighting up with a bright idea</i>)</span>: “Ask guide, John.”</p>

<p>The Man <span class="smaller">(<i>turning to guide, a sad person, long stricken by stupid
questions</i>)</span>. “Mister, are thoose things bananas?”</p>

<p>The Guide <span class="smaller">(<i>unable to rouse himself</i>)</span>: “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The Man <span class="smaller">(<i>confidentially to his wife</i>)</span>: “He says he don’t know.”</p>

<p>The Lady: “It makes no odds, John, they’re ower-ripe anyhow—but
the place is grand!”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And ‘the place is grand’ so truly defines the scene
<i>en route</i> to Villars, the phrase is so simple and comprehensive
and so true, that we have been lucky to
get it from the lady frae Lancashire even at the tail
of her lazy mental attitude. In one sense it is the
highest tribute that has ever been paid to our fairy
fastness of Villars-sur-Ollon—this conception of the
fir trees magic-laden with golden tropic fruit. If you
do not believe it, take the train at Bex, in the little
Rhone valley town of wooden houses where one dare
not smoke ‘<i>en cas de vent</i>’ for fear that a spark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
flying loose should ignite the street and render you
liable to a fine of six francs and confiscation of your
pipe. And surely, if you want the most thrilling of
all personal adventure-stories with which to startle
your own village on your return from a daring holiday,
this will suffice:—</p>

<p>“‘Strange places? Yes, I reckon I’ve seen some!
I remember one night I lost a two-franc piece in a
street in Bex. I struck a match to find it. Suddenly
a wind blew out the light, and a policeman came rushing
round the corner and arrested me. I was fined
six francs for striking a match in a gale—the wind
was no more than a draught from a window—and in
the dark the policeman himself picked up the two-franc
piece and walked off with it.’</p>

<p>“But I must not keep you too long with the fantastic,
for already your train is passing Gryon, built like a
bird’s nest in the hill, and soon Villars itself is reached.
There get out, and having drunken of the panoramic
ecstasy from the Diablerets round to the mountains of
Savoy, walk down the road towards Chesières, snugly
sleeping a hundred feet below Les Ecovets. You must
not go as far as Chesières however, for having crossed
the viaduct over the deep ravine a little beyond Villars
I want you to turn round quickly and tell me your
candid opinion of the picture—as soon as you can
get your breath. For here, surely, if ever you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sensitive to your environment, Beauty will take you
to her breast. The clustering fir trees, framed about
with velvet plots of green under a clear, blue-grey
sky; the suggestion of the infinite in the peaks tossing
in the heat-haze like a wild sea beyond the verge
of a far-away coast; the chastening awe of the
Glacier of Trient and the undertone of the gorge-water
below rising like the spirit of reflection bred
of the dense solitude of hill and sky—all these fine
miracles about you! For this is the charm of Villars,
that it lies a kind of lagoon of quiet beauty amid the
circling terror of pitiless frost and snow. ‘Domestic
felicity’ best describes the atmosphere of this little
hill-town, the wrath and terror of rock and glacier
mellowed by distance and yet near enough to heighten
by contrast the soft rapture of Villars reposing in
the arms of its hills. Go up another day to Les
Ecovets, and, looking across to Leysin and the Tours
d’Aï and away to Lac Léman and the dim-blue Jura
mountains, say if ever ruler of the world claimed
more glittering conquest than this of yours. For
whether you are mountaineer or one of the people
who ‘never walk’, the groves of Les Ecovets will
always lure you. Painter, poet, rhapsodist or mere
plain, blunt man, you there will find inspiration such
as is not written in any book. It must indeed have
been at Les Ecovets that the little English child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
waking suddenly from a noonday sleep, wished that
he were always ‘with Christmas’; for the magic of
all pines that ever mimicked an Alpine glade on
paper, the glamour of all the berries that made your
long-ago December a lustrous time in hearth and
hall, and the mystery of all Christmas memories of
other climes is here consummated in Nature’s own
most ideal, most artistic scheme. I know no place
like Villars for health and holiness: the high health
of crystal air and shining peak, the strange holiness of
solitude and the silent eloquence of the sky-embracing
mountains; for there in the palpable hush are the
mystic pipes of Pan that charm us on with tunes
played ‘not to the sensual ear’ but are ever making
for the spirit ‘ditties of no tone’.”</p>

<p class="caption">LEYSIN, SEEN FROM LES ECOVETS</p>
</div>

<p>I scarce know what more to say of Villars after
the moving eloquence of my friend; I am at a loss
for simile and dainty word. And yet, more must be
said. Not of Villars in the spring and summer—though
the secretive little pine-surrounded lake of
Chavonnes above Bretaye, and the steep slopes of
the Chamossaire, glorious with purple viola and blue
gentian, call insistently for notice—but of Villars in
its sun-drenched robe of snow; for in winter Villars
is amazingly transformed and its panorama need fear
no rivals in the Alps. There is a grander and more
Alpine note in winter; there is greater mystery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
austerity, sublimity in the wonderful alignment of peak
and col and glacier; there is, too, a greater suggestion
of power and vastness in the open landscape
than there is in summer; and yet, the while one
admires this wide-flung, steely grandeur, one is bathed
the livelong day in glorious sunshine, there being
no hours of shadow as at many winter resorts in the
Alps. A cloudless day at Bretaye on the Chamossaire
slopes, where ski-jumping is organized and
whence Mont Blanc and his attendant Aiguilles are
seen quite intimately, is a revelation in Alpine winter
scenery—the deep ultramarine forests, the crisp and
radiant snow, the intense warm-blue shadows, over
the whole of which reigns a purity that is dazzling.
But I must make way for a keen and skilful all-round
sportsman, well known as a leader at</p>

<h2>VILLARS IN WINTER</h2>

<p>“A few years ago Villars in winter was wrapped
in slumber as far as the outside world was concerned.
St. Moritz, Grindelwald, and Château d’Oex had long
been known to winter sportsmen, but Villars and its
vast possibilities from the point of view of sun worship
and sport could not long remain unknown to
the ever-increasing army of winter revellers in the
Alps. In 1906 the tide set in and one hotel opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
its doors for a few weeks, and in spite of the long
sleigh drive from Aigle, the diminutive rink, and
other drawbacks incidental to the first opening of a
new winter centre, the few score visitors were so
delighted with their experience that the name of
Villars was fairly launched upon the flood of popular
esteem. The railway from Bex was run in winter
for the first time in 1909, and since then the development
of this sunny sports-place has been astonishing.
Not only are all the hotels crowded, but numerous
châlets and private pensions have sprung up, and
the neighbouring resorts of Chesières, Arvèyes, Gryon,
and even the diminutive village of Huémoz—a few
miles farther west—now look upon the winter season
as more important than that of summer. This result
is in great part due to the wonderful natural position
of this centre, unsurpassed by any in the Alps.
Sheltered from the north by the range of the Chamossaire,
and on the east by that of the Grand and Petit
Muveran, the Dent Favre and the Dent de Morcles,
there is a magnificent view towards the south on the
Dent du Midi, the Glacier du Trient and the Aiguilles
Verte and Dru, and the horizon is wide and open
enough to allow a minimum of seven hours’ sunshine
in December, and the absence of wind enables skaters
and curlers to lunch on the rink without wrapping up
in mufflers and overcoats. But the situation is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
entitled to part of the credit for the prominent place
taken by Villars in the list of Alpine winter resorts.
A great deal is due to the wonderful organization of
the sports and the bold policy of those responsible in
spending large sums in making and equipping one of
the finest skating rinks in Switzerland and the finest
toboggan run outside the Engadine. The icemen
are the most skilled in their profession; the skating
instructors are past masters in their respective styles;
and the ski-ing professional attached to the Sports
Club is one of the most distinguished runners and
jumpers in the country. But besides these paid professors,
Villars has the advantage of having a committee
of organization, every member of which is an
adept in one or more branches of sport.</p>

<p>“Sport is indeed an amusement but also a business
at Villars. Visitors coming out from the fog and gloom
of an English winter are satisfied for the first few days
to revel in the glorious air and sunshine, to potter
about on skates or skis, or to toboggan in desultory
fashion, but when they have got their ski-ing and
skating legs and have learned to take the rink corner
of the ice-run without failing, they become filled with
enthusiasm to go for a long ski expedition, to do the
ice-run against time, or pass one of the skating tests
in either English or International style, or perhaps
they are tempted by the array of silver bowls or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
challenge cups. This is where the work of the committee
comes in. Each Sunday afternoon a body of
athletic, serious-looking men—presumably taking their
pleasures sadly like true traditional Englanders—may
be seen in earnest deliberation in a remote corner of
a certain smoking lounge. It is the Villars Parliament,
and the result of its protracted sitting is anxiously
awaited by the hundreds of visitors who crowd around
the ‘Programme for the Week’ posted on notice boards
in each hotel. For ski-ers there may be a run to
Bovonnaz, a gymkhana at Bretaye or a competition
for the Villars Golden Ski or Villars Ski-ing Cup, or
perhaps a test of the B.S.A. For skaters there may
be an ice carnival, a hockey match or an ice gymkhana,
or an N.S.A. test. Tobogganers may perhaps
be able to risk their limbs in a race against time on
the perfectly engineered but rather appalling-looking
ice-run, and curlers may perhaps note that they have
a chance of getting even with the Morgins or Montana
Curling Clubs, against whom each year out and home
matches are arranged. And when the day’s work is
over, and ski-ers, skaters, curlers, and tobogganers are
back in their respective hotels, feeling ‘splendidly fit’
after a bath and a meal, think you that they settle
down to an armchair and a pipe or a novel? Not
they!—the winter sportsman and sportswoman work
hard during the day, but the evening finds them still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
restless for amusement. The programme must therefore
show a succession of fancy-dress balls and <i>cotillons</i>,
bridge drives and bowling matches, or the committee
will be called a band of slackers, or perhaps they
may receive a deputation of fascinating young ladies
who wish to know why there has been only one
masked ball during the week in such and such hotel,
or perhaps some charming old ladies want to know
why they have not been catered for in the matter
of bridge or whist. Nor does the rush and movement
slacken throughout the season. No matter whether
one arrives in December or February one always feels
that the season is at its height. And so it goes on
until the ice begins to get soft and the rink has to
be closed for a couple of hours in the middle of the
day, and the ice-run is only open till ten o’clock,
and ski-ers have to start out betimes to make sure
of good snow, and at last, say towards the end of
the first week in March, the ice is no longer skateable,
the snow is too soft for long expeditions, and
the first flowers appear upon the Chamossaire. Spring
has come, and the winter sportsman, if he is not also
a botanist or flower lover but <i>is</i> a child of Custom,
will turn his face towards his home, thinking that
the Alps are ‘done for’ until July.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CHAMOSSAIRE, SEEN FROM VILLARS</p>
</div>

<p>“The only sport which Villars has hitherto lacked
is bobsleighing, and this has now been remedied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the construction of a bob-run nearly three miles long.
The new railway from Villars to Bretaye enables
bobbers to take full advantage of this run, and also
gives a great impetus to ski-running, as it brings
the ski-runner to a height of 6000 feet, and he is
then fresh for the Chamossaire—the classic run and
the scene of the Villars Golden Ski race—or the
Chaux Ronde, whence there is a wonderful view of
both the Oberland and the Mont Blanc chain. He
can also more easily do the long day’s trip to Château
d’Oex by way of Lac Chavonnes, La Forclaz<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and
the Col des Mosses, which is one of the most interesting
of expeditions, though it should only be undertaken
by a fairly expert runner.</p>

<p>“The snow on the Chamossaire is generally in
fine condition until the middle of January, but it is
exposed to the full heat of the sun, and the Chaux
Ronde on the opposite side of the valley affords better
running except after a fresh fall of snow. Among
other ski-runs to the north of Villars are La Truche
(5886 feet) and the Plan Chamois (6194 feet), which
may be done in two and a half or three hours with
one hour for the descent. The route lies through
Chesières and Les Ecovets, where there are some
excellent north slopes for practice. The snow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this run is best after a fresh fall or late in the season,
when the sun has changed the hard crust into the
watery surface on which the expert can run almost
as well as on powdery snow. The Chaux de Traveyannaz
is one of the best runs in the neighbourhood
and can be done in three and a half or four hours,
with descent to Gryon in about one and a half hours.
The best day’s expedition is that to Bovonnaz, and
the easiest way to do it is to take the early train to
Gryon, thence to the top in two and three-quarter
hours, and back to Gryon in about one and a half
hours. The snow on this run is nearly always in
perfect condition and the country is distinctly more
Alpine than that on the Chamossaire side. Chamois
are nearly always to be seen on the other side
of the ridge separating Bovonnaz from the Grand
Muveran, and on one occasion a ski-runner got a
good snapshot of a herd of these shy animals lazing
in the sun just on the other side of the ridge, quite
unaware of his presence until they heard the click
of the shutter. What a relief it must have been to
them to find afterwards that it was only a snapshot!</p>

<p>“Villars, whose rink is the second largest in
Switzerland, is now regarded as the most important
centre of English figure skating.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The English Figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Skating Club has a portion of the rink reserved for
its members, and tests of the N.S.A. are held weekly,
there being nearly always available a number of first-class
judges. Mr. E. F. Benson, the well-known
novelist, has made Villars his winter quarters for
several years. He is a gold-medallist of the N.S.A.
and has done a great deal for the encouragement of
English figure skating. His advice and assistance
are always at the disposal of the novice whose aspiration
is to get into one of Mr. Benson’s ‘figures’: as
a ‘caller’ of interesting figures he has no superior.
The <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i> of the vast rink would not
seem itself without the bronzed and hatless head and
the white-gloved, immobile hands of this great exponent
of the smooth and ungymnastic art of English
figure skating. Easy? Try it! Its very calm, rigid,
and unemotional facility is its enormous difficulty.</p>

<p>“But the International skaters are not neglected;
for they, too, have their enclosure, and it is generally
occupied by a number of seriously active practitioners.
There is also an intermediate or amphibious class of
skater which has not made up its mind which style
to adopt, and these—they are known facetiously as
‘Baby Wobblers’—are allowed to use the waltzing
enclosure by passing quite a simple test.</p>

<p>“Then, the weird cry of the curler is loud in the
land; for curling is perhaps the most flourishing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
most highly organized of all branches of sport at
Villars, and the Henderson Bishop Cup for ladies and
the Holmes Tarn Cup for men are among the most
coveted of Villars trophies.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A word must be said of
a recognized and quaint institution at Villars—the
Curlers’ Court. The ceremony of initiation into the
ranks of ‘made curlers’ takes place in the dungeons
of the Hotel Muveran and is sufficiently terrifying to
the novice. The Court is generally held after the
initiation ceremony; the president is styled ‘My Lord’
and his assistant is his ‘Officer’. The rules of the
Ancient Order of Curlers are strictly observed and
any breach of these rules is visited by a fine ranging
from five centimes to one franc. Thus one may be
fined for having a bald head or a bad cold, another
for not being as handsome as he might be, or for
the size of his boots; speaking or rising without his
Lordship’s permission is also fineable. A well-known
skater—one of the few honorary members of the
Villars Sports Club—is frequently fined for not paying
more attention to the noble pastime of curling.
When the Court rises (with the President’s permission,
of course), the fines are auctioned for the benefit
of the club and frequently realize large sums. All of
which savours not a little of Mr. Punch’s famous set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of rules for the Bushey Art School; and it is all so
very, very serious.</p>

<p>“Ice Hockey has become very popular in Switzerland
of late, and Villars was one of the first centres
to join the Swiss Ice Hockey Association. Matches
are played annually against neighbouring clubs, and
teams occasionally come from Zurich and even from
such distant places as Brussels and Prague. The
scene on the rink when a match is in progress is
one of great animation, the enclosure being surrounded
by a crowd of skaters of both sexes who
shout themselves hoarse encouraging the Villars team.
The ladies frequently have matches against the men,
who play left-handed, and also against the boys. It
is here that La Combe and the Château de la Rosey
from Rolle,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and Sillig’s school from Vevey have won
some of their spurs.</p>

<p>“I have mentioned the ice-run on which only
skeletons<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> are allowed, but there is also an equally
well made though smaller and easier run on which
only ordinary Swiss <i>luges</i> are allowed; and this is
used chiefly by ladies and children. Races are held
regularly, and as this run lies parallel with the skeleton
run for a great part of its length, the same telephone
can be used for timing these races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I have already said, the spirit of activity is
indefatigable at Villars. When the day’s outdoor excitement
is over there comes more excitement indoors.
The Dramatic Club gives several performances each
season on the fine stage at the Hotel Muveran, among
its repertoire being <i>The Villain of Villars</i> and <i>Violet
goes to Villars</i>, both from the facile and ingenious
pens of Captain and Mrs. Holmes Tarn, and far
above the usual amateur productions.</p>

<p>“I must, however, cease. Indeed, I have no permission
to go further. Much more could, and really
ought to be said, but perhaps the foregoing is sufficient
to show what Villars can do for winter sportsmen.</p>

<p>Yes; more undoubtedly could be said. In fact, a
book such as this could well be written about each
of the places we are visiting. But necessity is inexorable,
and we must leave this very night for Aigle,
though high fête is in the air and the huge rink is
illuminated with Chinese lanterns, and a masked and
costumed cortège, led by the stentorian strains of the
village band, with Mr. Dobbs as majordomo at the
head, is shuffling and gliding slowly round preparatory
to dispersal for a display of gorgeous fireworks. Had
it been daylight we might have walked down by way
of Chesières and Huémoz to the large village of
Ollon, home of the accomplished painter, Frédéric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Rouge, one of Switzerland’s most sincere and virile
draughtsmen, and thence to our destination. As it is,
we must return the way we came and take train from
Bex to</p>

<h2>AIGLE</h2>

<p>A quiet old market town to-day, and <i>chef-lieu</i> of
the largest district in Vaud, Aigle in 1529 was selected
by Berne, after the disputation in the Cathedral of
Lausanne, as the starting-point for the preaching of
the Reformation, and it was here that Farel, Calvin’s
noisy mouthpiece, made his first proselytes. The
many-towered old castle, standing upon higher ground
at the back of the town and amongst the vineyards,
dates from the thirteenth century, but was burnt by
Berne and afterwards rebuilt by her in 1534; to-day
the great central tower serves as a prison, and in the
body of the building is held the district court of
justice. Not many years ago certain recesses in the
woods at the back of Aigle were famous as the haunt
of the lovely and scarce brown and gold Lady’s
Slipper orchid; but, alas! that is of the past. Aigle
at present is mostly noted among strangers for its
golf links and the skating that is to be had on what
is known as the Old Rhone—an ancient bed of the
river now running a mile or so away; it is also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
station at which one alights for Leysin, Sépey, and
the Vallée des Ormonts. Much as I would like to
walk up the picturesque Ormonts valley to Ormonts-Dessus
and Vers l’Eglise at the foot of “<i>le bastion
titanesque et dévasté des Diablerets</i>” (quoting M.
Jules Monod, of guidebook fame) and study the flora
of which Mr. H. Stuart Thompson, the well-known
botanist, speaks so highly, and hear from the
peasants stories of the bellicose demons who infest
the wild summits and war among themselves, using
huge rocks as missiles; much as I would like to visit
Sépey and the ruins of the Château d’Aigremont,
where there is a subterranean passage in which it
is said the last Lord of Aigremont is shut up with
an awful horned ram, and is engaged in counting and
recounting his hoarded treasure; or to push on to the
Col des Mosses amongst the exquisite fields of flowers;
or—— But it cannot be! We must adhere to the programme
and must now take the electric railway that
mounts to</p>

<h2>LEYSIN</h2>

<p>There is a note of sadness in the journey, notwithstanding
the extreme beauty of the landscape;
for Leysin is one of the most noted stations in
Europe for the treatment of pulmonary disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
With its numerous and huge sanatoria dotted about
near the forests above the old village and its church,
built in 1445, upon the southern slopes of the curiously
striking Tours d’Aï, whose gaunt and ruddy cliffs
dominate the whole and protect it from the bitter
north and north-east winds, Leysin is a veritable sun-trap
and has long been known as a successful agent
in the fight which the skilled doctors wage for health.
The perspective, too, must aid considerably both
patients and doctors in the struggle, for it is second
only to that from Villars. Perhaps it is in winter
that Leysin is seen at its brightest and best, and
Mr. L. A. Emery, President of the Leysin Sports Club,
has kindly contributed the following authoritative
information about this famous centre when it is
stirred by the spirit of</p>

<h2>WINTER PASTIMES</h2>

<p>“Although Leysin is a resort for invalids for
whom all violent exercise is forbidden, yet it should not
be forgotten that out of these 4000 winter residents
there are at least 1000 onetime patients who have
been completely cured, and who return year after
year to the slopes that gave them back their health.
This explains a seeming paradox—the immense enthusiasm
for winter sport and the number of sensational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
victories that stand to the credit of Leysin’s sportsmen.
By reason of its altitude (1450 metres) and its
unique position sheltered from the winds, Leysin is
assured of good snow everywhere, excellent ‘runs’,
and smooth ice on its rinks. All sports are popular—Bobsleighing,
Tobogganing, Ski-ing, Skating,
Hockey, Clay-pigeon Shooting, and Rifle Shooting;
and all is directed by the <i>Sporting Club de Leysin</i>,
one of the most important of its kind in Switzerland.
The club was formed ten years ago (1903), at an
epoch when engineered runs were unknown and sportsmen
and sportswomen were content with the homely,
modest <i>luge</i>. Davos had only begun to know the
bobsleigh in 1902, and Leysin, not wishing to be behindhand,
joined two <i>luges</i> together with a board, and
thus was <i>à la mode</i>. The success of this contrivance,
rushing down the slopes, spreading consternation and
terror among oldfashioned <i>lugeurs</i>, and beating all
records for speed, was immediate and enormous. The
example of this pioneer bob was quickly followed, and
then it was that the Sporting Club offered its first
Challenge Cup, and soon began to carry off cups from
rival centres. Its list of victories is indeed significant of
its members’ prowess. For instance, at Davos, in 1904,
the <i>Coupe de France</i> was won by the bob <i>La France</i>
(Captain Bonford), and the same year the same Leysin
captain won the championship of Vaud and also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
championship of the Vaudois Alps. This latter championship
was won again a few years later by the
bob <i>Russie</i> (M. Coussis). In 1910 M. Renaud de la
Fregeolière, on his bob <i>Jeanne d’Arc</i>, carried off the
<i>Coupe du Président de la République</i>, creating a
record that has not yet been beaten; and the same
bob won the <i>Coupe du Mont Blanc</i> at Chamonix.
In 1913, with M. Coussis at the steering wheel and
M. Ewald at the brake, the bob <i>Russie</i> won the
Challenge Cup of the <i>Association Suisse Romande
des Clubs de Bobsleigh</i> against fifty competitors.
Leysin, indeed, is in the front rank of bobsleigh racing,
and the club actually offers, besides innumerable
lesser prizes, six Challenge Cups for this one form of
sport: The <i>Coupe de Leysin</i>, <i>Coupe Hansmann</i>,
<i>Coupe Handicap Garlakass</i>, <i>Coupe du Sporting
Club de Leysin</i>, <i>Coupe Régionale</i>, and <i>Coupe de
l’Association Suisse Romande</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">MONT BLANC AND THE AIGUILLE VERTE, FROM BRETAYE</p>
</div>

<p>“But if bobsleighing takes the lead at Leysin, the
other sports are not by any means neglected. The
hockey team is a strong one, and in 1910-11 Leysin
was the scene of the first round in the tournament
for the Swiss National Championship, and will be
the scene of the second round in the tournament for
1913-4. The Captain of the Swiss National team,
M. Bernard Bossi, was for two years President of the
S. C. L., and no fewer than three Leysin players were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in the International Hockey Tournament at Chamonix
in 1913. Ski-ing is not, perhaps, in such high favour
as at Villars and Morgins, yet it has no lack of
devotees, for whom there are gymkhanas as well as
two running competitions carrying two Challenge Cups.
There are, too, gymkhanas and carnivals for skaters,
and in the long list of prizes in this section are a
Challenge Cup for racing and another for figure
skating. Nor is the modest <i>lugeur</i> forgotten in these
contests; and, in this regard, one day is set apart
especially for the villagers.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> And over and above all
this activity are the shooting matches, pigeon shooting,
or ball-trap being particularly popular here in
winter, attracting some of the finest shots in Switzerland.
Rifle shooting, also, is admirably installed, and
meets with keen support, the winners in the numerous
competitions receiving gold, silver, and bronze medals.</p>

<p>“To say that apart from the Challenge Cups already
mentioned, there are seventy other cups to be won,
is to say that Leysin flourishes remarkably in the
realm of winter pastimes.</p>

<p>Looking across the Rhone valley to the Dent du
Midi, a rift in the hills can be seen through the blue
haze: that is the Val d’Illiez, whither we must now
turn our steps in order to gain Morgins and Champéry,
tucked cosily away almost upon the frontier of Savoy.
As we leave the sunny slopes of Leysin to take train
for Aigle, there comes a striking demonstration of the
healthful beneficence of snow when treated sanely.
In the hot sunshine, upon the glistening snowfield, little
children, boys and girls, wearing nothing but bathing-drawers,
hat, and snowshoes, are ski-ing bravely, or
are snowballing each other, boisterously happy in the
stinging warmth of it all. They are the tiny patients
of a doctor who is proving in miraculous fashion the
health-giving power in Switzerland of what in England
gives us the shivers and compels us to put on extra
clothing. It is distinctly reminiscent of what snow
can do for chilblains and frostbites—the glow of life
that it imparts; but I must not be supposed to be
advocating it as a general and pleasurable practice
to be followed by all and sundry in the Alps in
winter.</p>

<p>Once back at Aigle, we must take the little local
railway that crosses the Rhone and lands us at the
quiet market town of Monthey, in Valais, and at the
foot of the Dent du Midi, whence an electric mountain
railway will take us to Champéry. The fault about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mountain railways connected with the railways of the
plain is that you are apt to go right through to your
destination, thus missing much that is of interest <i>en
route</i>. This applies to Monthey; for all around this
cigar-manufacturing <i>bourg</i> there is much that really
repays a halt. So halt we will.</p>

<p>Passing through the marketplace and crossing
the old covered wooden bridge spanning the Vièze—a
swift little river hurrying to join the Rhone, and
whose source is in the mountains beyond Champéry—and
following the road which rises straight in front
of us across steep chestnut-shaded slopes, we come
to the delightful hamlet of Choëx, the elegant white
steeple of whose small white church is so prominent
a landmark from Bex. In spring and early summer
this quiet retreat, perched high among the rolling
woods at the base of the Dent du Midi, and with its
broad view across the Rhone valley to Villars, Leysin,
the Tour d’Aï, and the Diablerets, is very charming.
There is here, too, a wonderful wealth of flowers
beneath the chestnut trees and in the woods and fields;
indeed the neighbourhood of Monthey is quite as
interesting in this respect as is the neighbourhood
of Bex, and it can produce certain gems that are
strangers on the other side of the valley. Not far
from the road at <i>Fin du Bruit</i> an ancient Druid’s
altar has been discovered: great formidable rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
placed mysteriously as if on purpose, with an underground
cavern beneath, containing, among other prehistoric
objects, a stone coffin with a skeleton inside.
Also in this subterranean chamber may be seen a crack
that extends upwards in the rock to beneath the altar-rock
above-ground, and some years ago I was told by
the custodian that it was through this crack that the
priests shouted up the messages of the gods to the
assembled and trembling people. This may have been
so, for it only follows the lines of the old Egyptian
oracles; but unfortunately the tendency is to fake, or
to supplement by the aid of plausible imagination, all
that is authentic in such remains as these, particularly
when a charge is made for viewing them. At any rate
I believe I am right in saying that the stone-coffined
skeleton, although genuinely prehistoric, was not discovered
where it now lies, but in the quarries on the
other side of Monthey. However, it is possible that
the owner of this skeleton in life was one who worshipped
in fear and trembling at this sacrificial altar;
and it is a fascinating process to picture on these quiet,
flowered slopes the quaking half-clad crowd, the human
victim prone upon the great rock-slab, the white-bearded,
white-robed priest with fanatic eye and gleaming
knife upturned to the heavens—and all the awful
ritual of those ancient heathen ceremonies.</p>

<p>And now we must push on to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h2>MORGINS</h2>

<p>Of course the orthodox way nowadays is to take
the train to the village of Troistorrents and then to
walk or drive to Morgins. Personally I prefer to walk
from Monthey, as in days past, keeping to the old
cobbled road as much as possible;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or, better still,
mounting the woods and forest which rise immediately
from the <i>Pierre des Marmettes</i>, and then crossing the
high pastures leading eventually down upon Morgins.
This latter route, although unusual, is preferable by
far for those lovers of Nature who are eager to reap
all they can from the delightful scenery. And then,
all the time to the left, for nearly five miles, towers
the glorious Dent du Midi with its seven peaks. I
imagine that there is no more individual, graceful, and
arresting mountain in the Alps of the whole wide world.
Like the Matterhorn, it stands out, a living personality
amid its neighbour mountains. As among the many
and striking peaks at Zermatt the eye rests at once
and all but always upon the Matterhorn, so among
the many and striking peaks in this district of the
Rhone valley does the eye immediately rest upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the Dent du Midi. One never tires of it. It is the
first and the last upon which one gazes; it is the
first and the last that one remembers afterwards
throughout one’s days. Neither chocolate boxes nor
picture postcards can dim its great appealing beauty.
No <i>telephote</i> contortion of its exquisite proportions,
in conjunction with an over-small Castle of Chillon, can
destroy its repute and fascination. Whether it be
seen in all its breadth from Montreux, Champéry, or
Lac Champex, or as a single peak from Bex or St.
Maurice, it is unique, inimitable. No wonder that it
was Javelle’s first absorbing love; no wonder that Juste
Olivier and Eugène Rambert were moved to voice its
mastering charms; no wonder that, before these other
wielders of poetic pens, Senancour made his home at
its feet and wrote rhapsodically of it in his famous
<i>Obermann</i>.</p>

<p>We have arrived at Morgins; or, at least, we have
it now before us, lying below the slopes we are descending—sheltered,
secluded, rustic little Morgins,
with its encircling hills, its dark pine forests and
ruddy stream, its hotels and châlets embedded in green,
and its quiet deep-green lake lying beside the Col de
Morgins, whence a road winds over into Savoy, down
the Valley of Abondance to Evian and Thonon on the
shores of Lac Léman.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The red iron waters of Morgins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
have been long famous in fighting anæmia, and the
quietude of the place itself is sought in summer by
those suffering from overwork. But of late it has
acquired a new fame, almost, if not quite, eclipsing
the old: a fame that Mr Arnold Lunn, one of the best
known and most intrepid of ski-ers in the Alps, has
consented to explain: the fame of</p>

<h2>MORGINS IN THE SNOW</h2>

<p>“The Englishman has marked out a few corners of
the Alps as being exclusively British. There are, however,
neutral zones where Britons and Continentals
meet, but the Englishman keeps in the main to certain
well-known routes. You will find him at Zermatt, at
Grindelwald, at Binn, and at Arolla. At Champex he
will be outnumbered, and at Morgins he was, until
quite recently, entirely unknown. It was the discovery
of Morgins as a winter sports centre that brought the
tardy Englishman to this retiring valley.</p>

<p>“Years ago I had looked across the waters of
Léman to the range of fronting hills, and idly wondered
whether some hidden and silent valley lurked among
their recesses. Leslie Stephen’s “Bye Day in the
Alps”, which I discovered in an old <i>Cornhill</i>—it was
not reprinted in the “Playground of Europe”—gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
form and personality to an outstanding sentinel of these
Savoy hills, but it was some time before I explored for
myself these outlying heights that guard the central
citadels of the Alps. Since then I have often revisited
the long defile that leads to Morgins.</p>

<p>“You reach Morgins by a curious little mountain
railway that connects Monthey and Champéry. At
Troistorrents you leave the train and prepare for a
sleigh drive up the valley which branches off to the
right. Troistorrents is a characteristic Alpine village.
It lies in the heart of the Val d’Illiez, one of the loveliest
of Alpine glens, which is still quite unspoiled. The
big hotels of Champéry are hidden from view and there
is nothing to disturb the quiet music of the three
streams that meet below the parish church, and give
to Troistorrents its name. Of course the chief glory
of this valley is the incomparable Dent du Midi. This
mountain, or rather this grouping of separate and
successive rock towers, has a curious fascination; it
is so distinctive. There are domes not unlike Mont
Blanc, pyramids that resemble the Matterhorn, peaks
very like the Weisshorn; but in the whole Alpine range
you will find no match to the Dent du Midi. Its outline
is unique. Its history is interesting, and considering
its moderate height it has attracted a very large
share of Alpine literature. Like so many mountains,
it was first climbed by the parish priest of a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
valley.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Its conquest occurred in 1784. Sixty years
later five men of the Valais climbed the beautiful
eastern peak that rises like a lion above the towers
of Bex. The last turret, the Eperon, only yielded its
secret as late as 1892.</p>

<p>“Those who have read Javelle’s delightful Alpine
memoirs will remember the fascination which this peak
influenced on the great climber. ‘I am completely
captivated,’ he writes, ‘by the Dents du Midi … is
there anything astonishing in it? For two years it has
been before my eyes every moment of the day.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
eastward aspect of my window provided that the first
image on which my waking eyes should rest was its
graceful and slender profile. At table a malicious fate
had chosen my place so well that between my two
opposite companions the seven peaks of the <i>arête</i> were
visible to me in a frame. What I specially love is the
eastern peak. She may not be the highest, but is she
not the proudest, the slenderest, the most beautiful?
Is it not the peak which gives the mountain all its
character, and, in spite of the few metres by which
her western sister overtops her, is it not she who first
strikes the beholder and who dwells in the memory?’”</p>

<p class="caption">VILLARS: THE MOUNTAINS OF SAVOY</p>
</div>

<p>“Let us first dispose of the rough guidebook facts.
Let me tell you that Morgins is 4800 feet above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sea level; that it enjoys more than its fair share of
snow; that it is one of the great ski-ing centres of
the Alps; and that the sun can find its way to the
rink during the best part of the day, while it discreetly
keeps off the northern ski-ing slopes save for
a short interval too brief to damage the snow.</p>

<p>“Each winter sport centre has its own peculiar
atmosphere. Life at Morgins is comparatively peaceful.
We danced, of course; we played the usual
absurd games—trundling the potato and so forth—but
we were unmolested by a potato-trundling committee
with a special and peculiar badge. We were not
troubled by those who come to the winter Alps in
order that they may bask in the sun. The men of
Morgins were built of sterner stuff. Morgins will go
down to history as the home of a great renaissance.
The English School of Skaters, driven out of their
old shrines, have founded a new Temple at Morgins.
I do not know much about skating myself, though I
believe I am the worst skater that ever passed the
third-class test, but I am told by those who do that
English skating reflects our national characteristics
with most uncanny acuteness. I gather that the
main difference between the two schools is ethical.
The foreigner, when he wishes to make a ‘3’ turn,
waves his arms, kicks his leg into the air, sways
his body, and in general advertises his skill with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
little success. The ladies stand round and applaud,
while the English skater curls a contemptuous upper
lip. Not for him the vulgar <i>réclame</i>. Body stiff, unemployed
leg gummed firmly into his trousers, arms
rigid … a twinkle of the shoulder blade … a slight
movement of the little finger … and the hardest of
‘B’ turns is a thing of the discreetly successful past
… no ladies stop and applaud … only the initiated
can detect the amazing skill involved in this modest
performance. The aim of the Continental school is
to emphasize apparent difficulty. The ideal of the
English school is to conceal difficulty. They skate
for the joy of the thing, careless of applause. The
strong silent reserve of the Briton that scorns vulgar
advertisement finds perfect expression in the sedate,
dignified curves of the English school … I hope I
have made myself clear.</p>

<p>“But this is not an article on the rise and fall
and subsequent renaissance of the chaste and refined
school of skating. I must content myself with stating
that Morgins is the winter home of the great
apostle of the counter-reformation. Mr. Humphry
Cobb pilots his novices into the true faith. Mr. Cobb
and Rudolph Bauman between them could make ice
at the Equator, and the rink at Morgins is all that
devotion and genius can achieve. Ice making, as
Bauman understands the craft, is one of the fine arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it is as a ski-ing centre that Morgins is famous.
The classic expedition is, of course, the Porte du Soleil.
A mighty host left for this pass the morning after my
arrival. In the night it had rained at other centres
which shall be nameless, but at Morgins, which is a
well-behaved spot, it had snowed, and the old crust
was covered with a beautiful dusting of fresh snow
some two or three inches deep. It was a glorious
day. The clouds, that so often drift up after rain,
rested on the summits of the hills, and showed through
casual openings the blue sky of an Alpine winter.
We wandered slowly up a narrow valley, along a
stream gagged with the covering of snowdrifts, between
pines that had not yet shaken off the new load of
snow. We soon branched off to the left, and marched
up open slopes to a little châlet, where we had lunch.
Here he who had carried the beer had an opportunity
of testing the ratio of potential thirst as anticipated
in the valley, when the rücksacks were being packed,
with the actual thirst as exhibited on the mountain-side,
when rücksacks were unloaded. After the customary
pipe, and the still more customary remarks,
such as ‘Who would believe that one could sit in the
sun with one’s coat off in mid winter;’ or ‘Fancy
the poor fellows grinding away in their city offices;’
or again, ‘Just think of the …’; after, in short, we
had smoked all the tobacco that there was, drunk all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the beer that there was, made all the quips that there
were, ruptured all the infinitives that were still united,
and exhausted every cliché dear to those who describe
the Alps in winter—after all this (the proper ritual of
a ski-ing lunch) we turned upwards once more and
marched gaily forward to meet the pass. A long
upward stretch brought us to the foot of the last
slope, a few more tacks and the Dent du Midi shot
out beyond the portals of the sun. At any time this
view must be singularly beautiful; as we saw it the
vision from the pass had a peculiar loveliness. Fleecy
clouds driven up by the breeze, ‘shepherded by the
slow, unwilling wind’, rested on the highest snows
without materially restricting the view. The battlements
of the Dent du Midi were free from haze, and
the upper reaches of the Val d’Illiez, sadly brown,
formed a satisfying contrast to the snowy slopes round
Morgins. Poor Champéry! Scores of disconsolate
exiles, thirsting for the real winter, deserted Champéry
for Morgins during the course of the winter.</p>

</div>

<p>“Of the descent it is hard to speak with decent
restraint. There are some two thousand feet leading
direct from the pass to the glen. As we found them
the snow was in perfect condition. One put one’s
ski together and let gravity do the rest. You start
off with a thousand feet of easy, gradual slopes, which
you can take nearly straight. There is not a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
difficulty to give one pause; it is all plain sailing,
or rather plain ski-ing. Then comes a slight ascent,
promptly followed by one of the best bits of running
in the district. If you can take this stretch of some
thousand feet without using your sticks or pulling up
you are something of a runner. You begin with a
gentle swoop down into a hollow, you swing round
by a telemark or stemming turn, and then you have
a wide choice of some good snow for the next lap.
Follows a somewhat steep slope, which will give you
a chance of putting in four sharp curves; swing round
to the right, and then take the last stretch of a hundred
feet straight, and wind up with a Christiania
before the stream. The rest of the run home is not
so good, but it affords some very excellent short bits
and some pretty work through the woods.</p>

<p>“An alternative to this expedition is to cross the
Porte du Soleil to Champéry. You start with a stiffish
traverse, and then spin down some divine slopes to
the Col de Coux, winding up with a run down an
easy pass to Champéry. In a good season, when
there is plenty of snow at Champéry, this run is well
worth making. After an excellent light repast at
Champéry you return by road to Troistorrents, quite
enjoyable ski-ing of its kind, and then home either
on foot or by sleigh. Or you might sleep at Champéry
and return the next day over the same pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“The second expedition was almost as good as the
Porte du Soleil. In fact I am inclined to give it the
place of honour. Much the same party started off
quite gaily for the Bellevue. We climbed steepish
sunny slopes above the hotel for a couple of hours
to a typical little châlet, where we had lunch. One
of the party was something of an epicure, and he had
provided himself with a spirit lamp, and so we had
the benefit of hot tea—a great luxury. After lunch
two of us climbed still higher, to the actual summit.
It was well worth the slight additional toil. The
view was lovelier than I had anticipated. The Bellevue
is well placed, as it commands the great giants
of the Pennine Alps. In the west Mont Blanc towered
into a stainless sky. The Dent du Midi showed up
well above Champéry, and beyond on the left the
Combin showed terrace upon terrace of dazzling
snows. I fancy we also saw the Weisshorn and Dent
Blanche, but I am not certain on these points. Certainly
the chiefs of the Oberland greeted us from beyond
the Diablerets, and my companion hailed with
joy the cone of the Wetterhorn, which he had climbed
in earlier days. At our feet lay the long arm of
Geneva, and we made out with interest Chillon’s snow-white
battlements. The winter resorts above Montreux
looked woefully brown and bare of snow, and
we turned with satisfaction to contrast them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the white slopes of Morgins. We were more than
ever convinced that Morgins enjoys even more snow
than a place of its very respectable altitude deserves.
The view from the Bellevue has the charm of the
prospects from those lesser summits of the Alps that
are not too near the greater peaks to be overshadowed,
nor too remote to lose the essential majesty of the
greater giants. The blending of lake and forest, quiet
snow-clad hills, and forest-bound cliffs has a charm
lacking in the innermost recesses of the chain. The
descent to the châlet was very fine. The first hundred
feet required some care, but this was followed
by a long slope just steep enough to take at full
speed without any fear of a fall. A gentle swing
and a beautiful piece of snow brought us back to
the rest of the party. We then spent a merry half-hour
or so practising swings, and once more turned
to the pass between the Bellevue and the Corbeau.
This brought us on to the northern slopes, and a
perfect dive over steep, but not too steep, gradients
led to an opening in the wood, and by the time we
had run through the forest we felt that we had acquitted
ourselves tolerably well, and enjoyed some
capital sport. But there was much good snow still
to furrow. Some long, open slopes of good snow
gave plenty of opportunity to put into practice the
swings and turns we had been performing so gaily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
after lunch. These ended, the snow became worse,
and the last short stretch into the valley was not a
joy; we had descended some distance below Morgins,
and had pierced the belt below which rain had
descended instead of welcome snow. This short bit
was of very brief duration, and only served to accentuate
the glorious running above. At Vonne we had
a cup of tea and some delightful honey, and so home
across the short road pass.</p>

<p>“These are the only two expeditions which I can
vouch for from personal knowledge. But unless the
map lies, and unless other runners at Morgins also
speak the thing which is not, there must be a number
of other expeditions up to this standard. There
are fine slopes between Vonne and Chatel, and a
jolly expedition can be made to La Chapelle. The
Val de Morgins and its bounding hills still offer
plenty of prizes to the diligent explorer after new
routes, and the pass at the head of the valley should
certainly be crossed. For the mountaineer there are
fine high-level routes to Salvan, Sixt, and Chamonix,
and I fancy that the Dent du Midi would yield to
a determined attack, but I should advise the ski-runner
to tackle it from the south side, and not from
Champéry. It is best attacked in winter from the
Salanfe side, though this hardly comes into the category
of Morgins excursions. The rocks of the Dent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Jaune have a southern aspect, and should go quite
well in winter.</p>

<p>“But Morgins has other things to offer the visitor
besides the best ski-ing in this part of the Alps. (My
own private conviction is that the ski-ing at Morgins
will take a lot of beating, go where you will.) There
is an excellent skating and curling rink, beautifully
placed, within full reach of the sun’s attack. Mr. E.
F. Benson thought very highly of the situation and
upkeep of the rink. Then there is some very good
tobogganing, and I believe an ice-run is to be built
another winter. There are some glorious rambling
walks. You can slip over to France in half an hour
and take tea at Vonne; and in the evening there are
all the amusements associated with life in winter-sports
hotels. There is bridge for the sedate, and
bumps for the elderly, and dances for children and
Nature’s children, of whom there were not a few to
be found within a mile of Morgins. And there is—but
why add to this catalogue of good things? Those
who have gone to Morgins once will return there,
and those who have not will soon seek out this valley
in the Savoy hills, and find a certain reward.</p>

<h2>CHAMPÉRY</h2>

<p>Time presses, and to gain Champéry we must either
pass over the Col de la Chavanette or else go back to
Troistorrents and thence by the village of Val d’Illiez.
Like Villars, Champéry has experienced phenomenal
development within the past few years. Although for
long it has been patronized as a delightful summer
resort, it has more than doubled its importance since
its condition in winter was discovered to be anything
but disagreeable. This, of course, has been the common
experience of such places over almost the whole
of Alpine Switzerland, and it appears to synchronize
with the arrival of the ski from the north. The <i>luge</i>
has done something, and so has the bobsleigh, towards
Switzerland’s new-found prosperity in winter; but the
ski has contributed the most. Nor has the ski brought
a revelation only to visitors; it has caused even the
peasantry to take a new delight in their surroundings.
At Champéry, for instance, one may see not alone
the men and boys, but also the women and girls—wearing
businesslike trousers—practising the art on
the rapid snow-slopes.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Yet it is but yesterday that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the only outdoor winter distraction here was luging
down the village street and over the snow-covered
pastures; whilst strangers were noticeable by their
almost entire absence. It was in those quiet days
at Champéry, and about Christmas-time, that was
enacted one of the most impressive, haunting scenes
that ever I have witnessed in the Alps. Two young
men from Lausanne (if memory serves me, one was
an American) started from Salvan to walk over the
Col de Susanfe (about 7500 feet) to Champéry. As
nothing more was heard from them, parties of guides
from both Salvan and Champéry started out to find
them. The search was ineffectual for several days,
but at length the bodies of the poor fellows were
found below the Pas d’Ancel. I shall never forget
the sight, as the bodies, wrapped in sacking, were
brought upon hand-sledges through the village after
nightfall—the weird light of the torches upon the
snow and the awed faces of the villagers; the sturdy
band of guides, sad-visaged and weary; and the tense
silence of it all nothing but the scrunch of frozen
snow and the bated prayers of women. Here was
one of those strong, aery scenes which bring one face
to face with the grim side of life in the Alps, and
with the people’s stanch devotion, however difficult,
however daunting.</p>

<p class="caption">CHAMPÉRY: THE DENT DU MIDI</p>
</div>

<p>It may be that I look upon things Alpine with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
particular eye of the enthusiast for solitude; at any
rate I think that Champéry, in spite of its great
gaiety and <i>entrain</i> in winter and summer, is really
its most radiant, loveliest self in spring and autumn.
The lofty precipices of the Dent du Midi, the great
rock-masses of the Dent de Bonaveau and the Dents
Blanches are scarcely more bewitching or inspiring
than when dressed in the first snows of autumn or
the receding snows of spring. With what transporting
shine and fire does the Dent du Midi reflect the
autumn sunset; with what arresting energy do the
Dents Blanches in spring rid themselves of their winter
covering! Never can ravishing dreamland seem so
real, so concrete, as when, amid autumn’s soft, white,
drifting mists, the snowy summits of the Dent du
Midi glow clear coral-pink and crimson; never is
the renewal of life proclaimed more loudly or impressively
than when, beyond a calm foreground of glistening
crocus and dainty soldanella, titanic avalanches
hurl themselves upon the plateau of Barmaz.</p>

<p>Champéry and its surroundings are a nest of beauty-spots,
in which flowers flash and sparkle like a myriad
jewels. Unfortunately no space remains for detailing
these many charms; even not to tell where the white
rhododendron grows. There is, however, one spot
that cannot pass without some notice: the exquisite
<i>vallon</i> of Susanfe, by which climbers usually ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the Dent du Midi. Small as it is, it has all the
sweet severity and wild attractiveness of true Alpine
circumstance. Barmaz may possess a potent lure,
so may the Col de Coux and the Porte du Soleil,
but untamed, unspoilt Susanfe, though more difficult
of access, is pre-eminently seductive; it is, in
fact, the outstanding jewel in this neighbourhood of
Champéry. Desolation is there, to be sure, in the
hanging glacier and lingering snow, the gaunt rock
precipices and tumbled boulders, the avalanche-swept
turf, and cold-grey screes; but there, also, are the
myriad flowers of brightest Alpine hues, the swift and
babbling stream rushing to throw itself into the abyss
below Bonaveau, the little blue-green icy lake bordered
in part by walls of sunlit snow, and over all the glorious
solitude at times quite awesome.</p>

<p>Once upon a spotless autumn day I was sketching
there belated spring flowers next the snow. All was
still, save for the <i>peek-peek</i> of some small linnet-like
mountain bird among the boulders by the glacier-stream,
and the occasional shrill alarm-cry of marmots
disturbed whilst collecting grass for making tight and
snug their prospective winter quarters sounds which,
with their echoes, merely accentuated the prevailing
silence. Then of a sudden the air was rent as if by a
terrible explosion, and, looking up, I saw tons upon tons
of sea-green ice split from the glacier and come roaring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hurtling down over the rock-wall. The noise for a while
was deafening. Then all once again was silent, with
nothing to tell of the giant uproar but the amethyst-blue
scar above the precipice. Never in my life have
I felt solitude so acutely; never have I felt so insignificant
and paltry. Not far off among the edelweiss,
I knew, was a shepherd and his flock of three or four
hundred sheep; but in the presence of this devastating
force of “inert” nature, solitude and loneliness were
mine in all their belittling power.</p>

is one quarter of the globe where their unqualified discourse is out of place it is
in the Alps. On the fiftieth anniversary (1913) of the Swiss Alpine Club there were
those who did not hesitate to say: “Close your doors; your usefulness is past!”
Just fancy! Why, the club was never more virile in its life; never more youthful;
never more useful! The Alps have still much to give and tell men; in fact, as
regards the generality of mankind, they are a mine of physical health and mental
wealth that so far has only been scratched. And the club is needed to this end.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
